
This directory contains files that are required to build and/or run
JaxMe.

Files required at run time and build time:

xml-apis.jar     This is the Xerces XML Parser, as distributed with
xercesImpl.jar   Xerces 2.6.2. At runtime, you may replace this XML
                 parser with any JAXP 1.2 compliant XML Parser. At
                 built time, you may choose to use another XML Parser
                 as well, however, you need to adjust the build scripts
                 in that case. See http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j
                 for details on Xerces. Note, that parts of Xerces
                 apply to the DOM and SAX license.

Files required at build time:

                 for Java, as distributed with hsqldb 1.7.1. It is used

                 for details.

                 Note, that the hsqldb Jar file is *not* part of the
                 JaxMe CVS, for licensing reasons. You need to copy
                 the file from the native HSQLDB distribution.
