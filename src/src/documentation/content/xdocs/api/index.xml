    <title>JaxMeAPI: A clean room implementation of the JAXB API</title> 
  </header> 
  <body> 
      <p>
        JaxMeAPI is clean room implementation of the JAXB API. Unlike the
        <link href="ext:ri">reference implementation</link> this one
        comes under a very moderate open source license, the
        <link href="site:license">Apache License</link>.
      </p>
      <note>
        The reference implementation is now distributed from 
        <link href='ext:jaxb-si'>Java Dot Net</link>.
        Though the source may be viewed, the license model used does not
        really seem to be open source (in the usual sense of 
        <link href='ext:open-source-definition'>
        The Open Source Initiative</link> definition).
        Our implementation (of the basic API)
        is licensed under the Apache License
        a truely open source license allowing easy redistribution.
        Therefore, we continue to recommend our implementation.
      </note>
      <p>In terms of Jar files, the JaxMeAPI is equivalent to the following
        Jar files from the reference implementation:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>jaxb-api.jar</li>
        <li>jax-qname.jar</li>
        <li>namespace.jar</li>
      </ol>
      <p>JaxMeAPI was written as a part of the <link href="site:jaxme2">JaxMe 2</link>
        project. It is available as a separate module to be included in
        source distributions of JAXB client applications. Perhaps other
        JAXB provider implementations. might be interested too at some
        point.</p>
